# 1821. Find Customers With Positive Revenue this Year

## Problem Description

You are given a DataFrame named `Customers` with the following columns:
- `customer_id` (int): The customer’s unique identifier.
- `year` (int): The year of the revenue record.
- `revenue` (int): The customer’s revenue in that year (can be negative).

Write a solution to report the IDs of customers who had **positive revenue in the year 2021**.

Return the result as a DataFrame with a single column: `customer_id`. The order does not matter.

**Input DataFrame:**

| customer_id | year | revenue |
|-------------|------|---------|
| 1           | 2018 | 50      |
